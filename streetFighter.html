            <h2>The origins</h2>
            <p>Street Fighter was originally designed by Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto and was first launched
                in arcade games in the year of 1987.
                The player plays as martial artist Ryu, who competes in a worldwide martial arts tournament spanning
                five countries and 10 opponents.
                A second player can join in and plays as Ryu's American rival, Ken. The player can perform three punch
                and kick attacks, each varying in speed and strength, and three special attacks:
                The Hadouken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, performed by executing special button combinations.
                Street Fighter was ported to many popular home computer systems of the time, like the PC. In 1987, it
                was released on the NEC Avenue TurboGrafx-CD console as Fighting Street.
                Street Fighter was later included in Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for the PlayStation Portable,
                and Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
                Most recently, a port was included in the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection for Eighth
                Generation consoles and Windows.
