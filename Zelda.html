            <h2>The origins</h2>
            <p>
                The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action, adventure/battle
                gameplay, and exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the
                series, but with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later games in
                the series also include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while
                proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be
                beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is
                frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or
                exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout
                the series such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and to
                open blocked or hidden doorways..
